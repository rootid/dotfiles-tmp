-- Value individuals and interactions over processes and tools
-- Value working software over comprehensive documentation
-- Value customer collaboration over contract negotiation
-- Value responding to change over following a plan

Developers dislike:
- Loosely estimating dates, then having management set them in stone
- Spending more time talking about things than it would take to do them ("planning")
- convincing business leaders that engineering is more than just writing code
- sitting in meetings that add little value to the team
- arguing over made up numbers for vague deliverables
- having their mistakes, miscalculations, and other normal aspects of software development enumerated and held against them, as though it was an actual problem
- having "scrum masters" come up with straw men to justify even more process
- reporting to too many non-technical managers
